# PostGIS examples: MGUG 2019 conference
A mini tutorial on some basic GIS transformations using PostGIS functions.
This was presented at the 2019 Manitoba GIS user Group conference in Winnipeg.

Exercise 1: transform vector data using Postgis

We will see how to take a vector file of electoral bounaries of the province of Manitoba:<br>

Then take a vector file of a selection of key waterways:<br>

And use PostGIS functions to transform the original map by using the water layer as a "cookie cutter"<br>
